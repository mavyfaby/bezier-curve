## Bézier Curves

>A Bézier curve (/ˈbɛz.i.eɪ/ BEH-zee-ay) is a parametric curve used in computer graphics and related fields.
The curves, which are related to Bernstein polynomials, are named after French engineer Pierre Bézier,
who used it in the 1960s for designing curves for the bodywork of Renault cars.

## Linear interpolation

> In mathematics, linear interpolation is a method of curve fitting using linear polynomials
to construct new data points within the range of a discrete set of known data points.
